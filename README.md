This is how Finland discussed home cooking during the corona pandemic

What did Finns discuss about fast-moving consumer goods on social media during the corona pandemic? Were there positive, negative and neutral feelings associated with home cooking? Which emerged as the most common themes and did time matter in the discussion?

I sought answers to these questions. Social media data from January 2020 to April 2021 was available, containing a total of about 36,000 lines of information. The messages were extracted from the Meltwater database, where search themes were related to cooking, home cooking, or everyday food. In the data, the most common keywords in the discussions were related to home cooking, cooking, everyday food, and home-cooked lunch.

I analyzed a large amount of data with Python, where I utilized libraries for understanding different natural languages. The aim was to specify the topics that appear most in the messages, ie the terms and topics that appear most frequently in the conversation data. Among other things, I calculated the most common adjectives, nouns, names, and concepts from conversations. I went through the data with sentiment analysis, which categorizes text-based messages, or tweets, by tone. The tone can be either positive, neutral or negative.

The most popular home dishes are pasta, curry chicken and pizza

First of all, according to the results, Finns value good quality, ease, tastiness and deliciousness in home cooking. The most common home cooking ingredients were related to pasta, curry chicken, pizza, steak, and chicken.

Second, the tone of the conversation in home cooking in general was quite neutral. Four out of five (77%) messages were neutral in tone, one in ten (13%) positive and six in 100 negative.

I took a closer look at the negative sentiments that have been the subject of word cloud analysis. The larger the word font, the higher the frequency in the text data.
In a negative tone, home cooking was associated with, among other things, hoarding, exhaustion, cooking within four walls, canned soup, and meatballs. In a positive sense, home cooking was associated with health, ease and deliciousness, as well as environmental responsibility. Among other things, food made with photovoltaics became one of the positive topics in the discussion.

The most popular channels are Facebook and Twitter

Third, time was related to the number of conversational reactions from January 2020 onwards. Engagement, or conversational reactions to home cooking, began to rise sharply on social media with the guidelines on interest rate restrictions in March 2020 and remained at a high level until the summer of 2020.

The second wave of reactions started at the end of November 2020 after the tightening of interest rate restrictions. Discussion reactions remained high until March 2021.
Fourth, in this 36,000 data row discussion sample, the five most popular discussion channels were Facebook, Twitter, discussion forums, blogs, and Youtube. Most of the messages were sent from Finnish growth centers. The TOP 5 cities were Helsinki, Tampere, Turku, Vantaa and Oulu. The most common language of conversation was Finnish (94%).

In summary, the most common positive themes of Finns about home cooking were related to ease, good quality and healthiness. Finns prefer inexpensive raw materials for everyday meals and varied everyday food, and are ready to utilize everyday food recipes and, if necessary, new ideas.
